# sqlalchemy-challenge
## Description
In this project, I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. In order to plan the trip, I've decided to do a climate analysis about the area. There're 2 parts to this project. In Part 1 of the project, I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, I have used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. In part 2 of the project, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I have just developed in Part 1. 

## Installation
The following dependencies have been installed for this project:
1)sqlalchemy: automap_base(sqlalchemy.ext.automap), Session(sqlalchemy.orm), create_engine, func and desc.
2) matplotlib.pyplot (as plt)
3) numpy (as np)
4) pandas (as pd)
5) datetime (as dt)
6) Flask: jsonify
7) json

## Usage
To see the code for Part 1, navigate to the SurfsUp folder and open climate_starter.ipynb.

To see the code for Part 2, navigate to the SurfsUp folder and open app.py.

*note: in order to make my JSON output more descriptive, I've added 'station' as the key and the station's name as the value for each key:value pair for question 3 of Part 2. I've done the same for question 4 (adding the date key:value pair and temperature key:value pair to make the json output more descriptive).
